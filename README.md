# Project Title - ANTI-SLEEP GLASSES
Accordingly there is a need for devices that work reliably, and keep the user awake efficiently. So, we have come up with a ANTI-SLEEP GLASSES (ASG). This system alerts the user if he/she falls asleep at the wheel thereby, avoiding accidents and saving lives. This system is useful especially for people who travel long distances and people who are driving late at night.
